# Early_Objects_Practice
Contains my solutions to many of the programming challenges from "Starting out with C++: Early Objects (7th edition)"

I picked up this book as a required textbook for an intro level programming class in 2010. I never disposed of the book, even after making a career change, and returned to it every few years.
